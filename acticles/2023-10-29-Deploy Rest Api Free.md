## Introduction

This guide will walk you through the process of deploying backend applications and databases in a matter of minutes. Whether you're working on an educational project or just having fun, you can deploy your backend applications and databases for free. So, let's get started!

In the past, I always struggled to find platforms that were suitable for educational purposes. But today, I'm excited to share this platform with all of you.

## What's is FL0 ? 

[FL0](https://fl0.com) is a platform that allows you to deploy backend applications and databases in just a few minutes. It offers several key features:
 
- Connect to your GitHub repository to automatically deploy your applications.
- Support for various backend languages, including Node.js, Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, Go, Rust, and more.
- Compatibility with a variety of databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and more.
- Free access with limited storage capacity and one project.

FL0 provides you with the tools you need to bring your projects to life without the hassle.

## How to Get Started?

Getting started with FL0 is incredibly simple. All you need to do is create an account, then initiate a project and link it to your GitHub repository. From there, you can proceed to deploy your application. I'm thrilled to share how this platform has made it easy for me to deploy educational projects quickly in my favorite programming languages, without the complexities of setting up and configuring a development environment.

You can visit the [fl0zone](https://github.com/fl0zone) and choose any simple example in your preferred programming language. After that, connect it to your GitHub repository and deploy it. In just a matter of minutes, you'll have a fully functional application up and running.

As an example, let's consider deploying a server.py with a Flask API that returns user data. You can find a sample template at: https://github.com/chuongmep/template-python

```python
import os
from flask import Flask, send_from_directory, render_template, redirect,jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 5000))

users = [
    {"id": 1, "name": "User 1"},
    {"id": 2, "name": "User 2"},
    {"id": 3, "name": "User 3"},
]
@app.route('/static/<path:path>')
def serve_static(path):
    return send_from_directory('static', path)

@app.route('/api/users', methods=['GET'])
def get_users():
    return jsonify(users)

@app.route('/')
def home():
   return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/<path:path>')
def all_routes(path):
    return redirect('/')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(port=port)

```

Additionally, you can customize the appearance of your website by modifying the style.css and index.html files. Here's an example of the HTML and CSS code to create a simple web page:

index.html:

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>
    <meta content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" name="viewport">
    <link rel="icon" href="/static/favicon.png">
    <link href="static/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/canvas-confetti@1.5.1/dist/confetti.browser.min.js"></script>
</head>

<body>
    <div class="flares">
        <img src="static/images/flare-top.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"
            srcset="flare-top-500.png 500w, static/images/flare-top-800.png 800w, static/images/flare-top-1080.png 1080w, static/images/flare-top.png 1920w"
            alt="" class="flares-top">
        <img src="static/images/flare-right.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1622px) 100vw, 1622px"
            srcset="static/images/flare-right-500.png 500w, static/images/flare-right-800.png 800w, static/images/flare-right-1080.png 1080w, static/images/flare-right.png 1622w"
            alt="" class="new-flare-nav top-right hide-mobile">
        <img src="static/images/flare-left.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1518px) 100vw, 1518px"
            srcset="static/images/flare-left-500.png 500w, static/images/flare-left-800.png 800w, static/images/flare-left.png 1518w"
            alt="" class="new-flare-nav top-left hide-mobile">
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="hero">

            <h1>Hello from FL0.</h1>
            <p>Congratulations, you've deployed a Python web server with FL0!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="logo">
            <img src="static/images/logo.svg" loading="lazy" alt="">

        </div>
    </div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        document.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
            const x = event.clientX / window.innerWidth;
            const y = event.clientY / window.innerHeight;
            confetti({
                origin: { x, y }
            });
        });
        confetti();
    </script>

    }

    h1 {
        margin-bottom: 24px;
        font-size: 64px;
    }
}
```

You can use the `pip list` command to check the dependencies of the library you are deploying and then fill in the `dependencies` into the `requirements.txt` file. Here's an example of what your `requirements.txt` file might look like based on your dependencies:

```
Package                      Version
---------------------------- ------------
absl-py                      2.0.0
aiohttp                      3.8.6
aiosignal                    1.3.1
annotated-types              0.6.0
anyio                        3.7.1
appdirs                      1.4.4
archicad                     26.3000
argon2-cffi                  23.1.0
....
```

This requirements.txt file lists the Python packages and their specific versions required for your project. You can generate this file using the pip freeze command as well:

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Once you have set up your project and dependencies, you can take a few minutes to check the final result. Your project's URL may look something like this: https://f0-rest-api-dev-ztss.3.us-1.fl0.io

Additionally, you can view the results of the user list by visiting: https://f0-rest-api-dev-ztss.3.us-1.fl0.io/api/users

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "User 1"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "User 2"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "User 3"
  }
]
```

This allows you to see your deployed project in action and access the user data as intended.

## Conclusion

In this example, we successfully deployed a backend application with a Flask API that returns user data in just a few minutes. You can explore and try this approach with other programming languages like Node.js, Java, PHP, Ruby, Go, Rust, and various databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and more.

This platform is particularly valuable if you are deploying a backend to support educational purposes. You can find more information and resources at: https://fl0.com.

With the ease of deployment and flexibility offered by FL0, you can focus on your project and bring your ideas to life without the hassle of complex setup and configuration. Happy coding!
