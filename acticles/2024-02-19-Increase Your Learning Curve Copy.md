## Introduction

In this article, I will share with you some insights that have greatly helped me in my journey of learning and transitioning journey of learning curve. Despite facing many challenges, I will highlight some points that I have experienced, practiced, and successfully applied to help me accelerate my learning and work more efficiently.

Actually, there are only a few small aspects to consider. Let's delve into them.

## Knowledge Exchange

I leverage various relationships to exchange knowledge and troubleshoot during my learning and working processes. I frequently participate in forums, knowledge exchange groups, and team meetings to share knowledge and troubleshoot. Perhaps this is crucial in helping me understand where I am and what I need to do to improve myself, while also assisting others with similar issues that need addressing. Through this, I not only acquire new knowledge but also gain additional experience, especially by remaining humble in all circumstances.

Knowledge is never enough, and there's always something new to learn.

## Documentation

For me, watching videos only comes into play when I need to learn specific tricks or tackle certain tests. However, when delving deep into a topic, I prefer consulting documentation first, before resorting to Google, YouTube, or forums for information. This approach helps me save time and search for information more efficiently.

## Patience

This is something I take immense pride in. There were crazy ideas that no one supported me on during development, and some even viewed them as impossible or a joke I had conjured up. However, being patient and consistently sticking to the path I outlined helped me gain much more confidence in the product, leading to creations that meet future demands.

However, there were times when I felt exhausted and didn't want to continue anymore. Then I realized that's when I needed to rest and seek support from others, or go traveling, stroll around, hang out with friends, or even just sleep for an extended period. This helped me regain balance and the spirit to carry on with my work.

## Passion

What I've always wondered about until now is what passion truly is. Passion is when you find something you love, something you can work on for hours without noticing the passing time. Sometimes, you feel energized at 2 a.m. to implement a sudden idea that sparked in your mind. That's when passion begins. Doing something you're passionate about helps you progress further than ever before.

## Learning by Doing

I've noticed that many people rush to take exams and acquire hundreds of certifications without knowing what to do with them. I don't deny the value of learning, but I feel that learning by doing helps progress faster than ever. Instead of sitting for hours to watch, I prefer practicing, doing, exploring, experimenting, and troubleshooting. It's like learning to drive; you can't learn to drive just by reading books, you need to practice, practice, and practice.

## Keep Moving Forward

I often remind myself that nothing is impossible. Sometimes I feel like I can't do something, but then I realize that if I don't try, I'll never know if I can do it or not. Technology knowledge changes every day, and it's crucial to know how to adapt and progress. We don't know as much as we think we do, but we know that we've learned more than yesterday.

## Problem Solving

Problem-solving is a method I believe helps me learn more quickly. When I encounter a problem, I usually try to find a solution for it. If I don't know, I have to ask someone else. Sometimes, I need to start from scratch, from the basics, from things I don't know. This helps me learn more quickly and gain a better understanding of the issue.

Problem-solving is sometimes not just in work but in the problems that occur in everyday life. In fact, solving life problems can sometimes be even more challenging than solving work problems. But regardless, finding the best or most feasible method to solve a problem is something I always strive to do.
