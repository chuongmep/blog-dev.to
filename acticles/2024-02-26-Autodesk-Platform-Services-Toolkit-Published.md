## Introduction

I am excited to announce a significant development in data interaction and retrieval processes using [Autodesk Platform Services](https://aps.autodesk.com/) from Autodesk. Today, I am officially releasing the first version of a toolkit designed to facilitate data access, aiming to support AI processes, Data Analysts, LLM, and explore the boundaries where APS may fall short in providing for end-users.

[APSToolkit](https://github.com/chuongmep/aps-toolkit) is open-source, ensuring accessibility to all engineers, BIM developers, and data scientists. I am actively working on refining it further. Please feel free to provide any feedback in the comments below this post, and I will consider all suggestions.

## APS Toolkit

var token = Authentication.Get2LeggedToken().Result;
string urn = "dXJuOmFkc2sud2lwcHJvZDpmcy5maWxlOnZmLk9kOHR4RGJLU1NlbFRvVmcxb2MxVkE_dmVyc2lvbj0z";
var RevitPropDbReader = new PropDbReaderRevit(urn, token);
RevitPropDbReader.ExportAllDataToExcel("result.xlsx");
```

### Python

```python
from aps_toolkit import Auth
from aps_toolkit import PropDbReaderRevit
auth = Auth()
