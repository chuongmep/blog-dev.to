## Introduction

I have spent a considerable amount of time working with automation in my daily tasks. I have found that automation can save us a lot of time and effort. Like everything else, automation has its pros and cons. Today, I will share some reasons why automation can be the best choice in certain situations. Should we also reflect on what we have created?

It might seem that I am lazy, as I like to automate even the smallest things that others don't bother with, and then enjoy the results.

## Is Not a Solution for Everything

I have realized that many people overuse automation for everything, believing it can help them do everything. Some even think it will replace their jobs. This notion seems as crazy as recent trends related to Generative AI, where people get excessively carried away with something that appears uncontrollable.

When we undertake a task, we should truly master the core principles first. Here are some good questions to start with:

- Why do we need to automate this task?
- Do I have enough experience with this task to understand if it really needs automation?
- Can I perform it manually in a better way?

...

Ask these questions and find answers to them. Don’t automate everything without thinking. We are not machines; we create automation to help us work better, not to work more.

## Expertise

If I want to write an application related to cryptocurrency, I will first learn about cryptocurrencies. If I am developing a banking application, I will study how banks operate, such as credit control, transactions, etc.

This approach helps me understand what I am working on. It's impossible to automate something I don't fully understand. This deeper understanding allows me to create better applications. Many people involved in automation fall into the trap of performing tasks without fully understanding them. This approach might produce something functional, but it is challenging to create something truly engaging or even revolutionary in the field.

I belive that when you expert in something, you can automate it better than others, it make your tool more powerful and more useful.

## Complexity

Don’t get me wrong about complexity. Automation simplifies complex things, not making you a slave to even more complicated automation systems. Sometimes, we feel the need to add new features, which can be exciting. However, consider whether you truly need them and how often you will use them. I have built some features that I only used once and never touched again.

Complex things require time to understand and automate, but if we know how to break down these complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts, we will find that they are not as complicated as we initially thought.

::: tip Note
Problems are only truly complex when we do not fully understand them.

## Repetition and Repetition

Yes, automation helps make repetitive tasks less boring and easier to handle. However, if you are creating something that repeats what others have already done on the internet, you should reconsider. You might be working on something unnecessary. At a learning stage, this is acceptable, but if you are doing this in your daily work, you should think again. When an automation solution already exists, we should learn from it and use it. If possible, try to create a better version of it.

## Cost and Efficiency

Many people automate just to showcase something on `LinkedIn`, but they don't fully understand the cost and efficiency involved. I believe that if you don't grasp the cost and efficiency, you won't be able to create something truly effective.

If you create something confusing, overly complicated, and difficult to use, thinking it solves urgent user needs because it's automated, you're mistaken. Instead, you are frustrating users by forcing them to use or learn something cumbersome and unpleasant.

## A Dark Side of Automation

Avoid overusing automation. There are many things we can do better manually. Don’t let automation strip away the creativity from tasks that should be done manually, and don't let repetitive, mundane tasks consume too much time that could be spent on creative work.

::: tip Note
Recently, I've made it a habit to wake up at 6:30 AM just to brew a cup of Vietnamese coffee, which takes me 15 minutes with waiting and savoring, It helps improve skills and patience, and I enjoy the process. Coffee machines that take only a minute don't give me that experience, and I don't want to lose those feelings.

As you can see, life doesn't always need automation. Sometimes, doing things manually brings a joy that can't be found anywhere else. Depending on the person and the task, choose wisely.

## Summary

1. Don’t automate everything without thinking.
2. Learn the expertise before automating.
3. Break down complex tasks to make them simpler.
4. Avoid repeating unnecessary tasks.
5. Understand the cost and efficiency of automation.
6. Avoid overusing automation.

## Not Relate to Automation

[Peter principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle): The Peter principle is a concept in management developed by Laurence J. Peter which observes that people in a hierarchy tend to rise to "a level of respective incompetence": employees are promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another.

Navisworks is still a powerful tool, but it is not as widely used as it once was, if it move so slow, it will be dead soon when the new software or new technology come out, or people will move to cloud-based software like BIM 360 or ACC,...
