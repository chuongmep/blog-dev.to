## Introduction

Recently, I have noticed that many new programmers often struggle with problem-solving. This not only makes them doubt themselves but also causes them to lose the efforts they have made and accumulated. Among them, there are also some very experienced people who sometimes face the same situation.

Today, we will try to address this issue. How can we overcome fear and control our emotions when facing difficult problems?

## How It Happens

There are many reasons for this issue, some of the common ones are:

- You think you're not smart enough to solve the problem: Many people believe they aren't smart enough to solve problems. This isn't true. The issue isn't about intelligence but about how you approach the problem. If you understand what you're approaching and doing, what the goal is, and the small steps to reach that goal, you can solve the problem.

- You lack the patience to solve the problem: A difficult problem often requires patience and time. If you're not patient, you won't be able to solve it. Many people give up too early because they see fancy videos or read complex research reports. But they lack the patience of those who published them. Those people spent a lot of time and effort beforehand to achieve such results.

- Limited knowledge in a small area: This is true in the world of developers. New technologies and trends emerge so quickly, making it hard to keep up. This makes you feel like you don't have enough knowledge to solve the problem. The key here is that few people realize where they need to improve to accumulate knowledge daily.

- Overconfidence like an expert, but the level of confidence exceeds the limit to solve the problem: If you fall into the Dunning-Kruger effect, you won't be able to solve the problem. You need to realize that you're not an expert and need to learn and improve every day. Knowing where you stand helps in choosing problems and controlling your limits. If you exceed your understanding, it will quickly exhaust you and make you lose control.

- Not enough connection with people better than you: This might seem strange, but being around a kind and enthusiastic person makes you feel better and more positive than having a poor connection. This becomes clear if you observe over a few years of work.

- Not enough time to complete: Lack of time or miscalculating the time to complete a task is also a reason you can't solve the problem. Estimation requires a specific plan, and research demands a long-term process. It's not just a step forward in time but a long-term process.

- Chat GPT: Although it's a great tool, but some new programmers rely too much on it. They think it can solve all their problems. This is a big mistake. You need to understand the problem and the solution to solve it. If you rely too much on Chat GPT, you will lose your ability to think and solve problems. If you know about [Expert Beginner](https://medium.com/@housefrommars/what-is-expert-beginner-and-how-to-avoid-becoming-one-5b540890227f), you will understand how dangerous it is to rely too much on Chat GPT.

## How To Overcome

Every problem has a solution, sooner or later. Here are some ways to help you overcome fear and control your emotions when facing difficult problems:

- **Remember that you are not the smartest person**: This helps you realize that you need to learn and improve every day. Also, knowing where you stand helps a lot in choosing problems and controlling your limits.

- **Remember that you need to be patient**: There are always limits that one needs to overcome to bring even the smallest value. Patience is one of the important factors that help you overcome difficulties.

- **Be friendly and sociable with everyone**: This helps you receive support from those around you. They can help you overcome the difficulties you are facing.

- **Have a companion**: This gives you more motivation in your research and progress. You will see yourself improving quickly if you have the help of experts or those who are far ahead of you in that field.

- **Politics**: Internal politics only make you cowardly and weak, but life is always like that. We have to find ways to overcome it.

## Nothing Really Matters

I have a girlfriend in **Japan**. We travel, explore new places, and visit destinations together. Even though we have a significant language barrier, we still try to understand each other. We overcome difficulties together, learn about each other, and create beautiful memories.

The culture between **Vietnam** and **Japan** is very different, not just in language but also in lifestyle, perspectives, and problem-solving methods. It brings a very interesting experience.
