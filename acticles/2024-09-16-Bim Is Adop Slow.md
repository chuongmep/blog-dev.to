## Introduction

Every industry is facing the challenge of digital transformation, and the AEC industry is no exception. The AEC industry is highly fragmented, involving many stakeholders throughout the project life cycle.. The industry is also known for its slow adoption of new technologies, and the BIM digital transformation is no exception. But why is BIM digital transformation moving so slowly?

## Lack of Standardization

Yes, We have many standards for BIM, but the lack of standardization is one of the main reasons why BIM digital transformation is moving so slowly. Let's try think about Tech industry, they have many standards like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. These standards help developers to build applications faster and more efficiently. 

In the AEC industry, we have many standards documentation but lack of standardization. in practice. This makes it difficult for stakeholders to collaborate and share information effectively.

In the AEC industry, while standards exist on paper, they are inconsistently applied in practice. This inconsistency creates barriers to effective collaboration and information sharing.

## Security Concerns

Security is a major concern for any industry, but it is especially important in the AEC industry. The AEC industry deals with sensitive information, such as building designs, construction plans, and financial data. The industry is also known for its lack of cybersecurity awareness, which makes it vulnerable to cyber attacks.

Furthermore, the AEC industry is highly regulated, with many laws and regulations governing the use of technology. As a result, companies face challenges in adopting new technologies while ensuring regulatory compliance.

## Lack of Skills

The AEC industry is known for its lack of skilled workers, and this is one of the main reasons why BIM digital transformation is moving so slowly. Many companies do not have the resources to train their employees in new technologies, and this makes it difficult for them to adopt BIM.

## Misconceptions About AI

AI is a powerful technology that has the potential to revolutionize the AEC industry. However, many companies mistakenly believe that AI will automatically solve all their problems, which is not the case.

Companies need to understand that AI is a tool that can help them achieve their goals, but first at all, they need to understand their problems before applying AI, and need to have a clear strategy for implementing AI.

## Data is Everywhere.

Data is the lifeblood of the AEC industry, and companies need to have access to accurate and up-to-date data to make informed decisions. However, many companies do not have the tools or resources to collect, analyze, and share data effectively. This makes it difficult for them to adopt BIM and other digital technologies.

## Conclusion

I believe that apply technology in AEC industry is a big challenge, but it is also a great opportunity for companies to improve their processes and deliver better projects. The key to success is to understand the challenges and opportunities of digital transformation and to have a clear strategy for implementing new technologies. Companies that embrace digital transformation will be able to stay ahead of the competition and deliver better projects to their clients.

If the company slow down the digital transformation, they will be left behind and lose their competitive edge. The time to act is now, and companies need to start investing in new technologies and training their employees to stay ahead of the curve for next generation of AEC industry.
