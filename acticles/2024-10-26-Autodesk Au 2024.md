## Introduction

This year, like last year, I couldnâ€™t attend [Autodesk University](https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/). There were several reasons, but the primary one was the cost. As an [Expert Elite member](https://www.autodesk.com/expert-elite/overview), I receive a complimentary one-night hotel stay, but the high price of airfare made the trip impractical. Instead, I decided to invest in books and online courses to further my skills.

Although I couldn't attend in person, I had the opportunity to try as an analyst data for Autodesk University Class 2024. Each year, Autodesk releases the AU class materials online, including slides, videos, and transcripts. While thereâ€™s no API available to retrieve this data, I applied my skills to collect and analyze it manually to share insights with the community. Due to the limitations of data crawling, Iâ€™ll only share my analysis here without the code.

So, letâ€™s dive in and see whatâ€™s new in [Autodesk University Class 2024](https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/). Iâ€™m excited to break down the most notable developments and share what Iâ€™ve found!

## How Many Speakers are at AU Class 2024?

From my analysis, I found that the number of speakers at Autodesk University (AU) Class 2024 has increased significantly. After counting across all classes, the total number of speakers I found is **1,075**! Thatâ€™s a substantial turnout, showcasing the depth of expertise and topics covered this year. ðŸ¥¶

### Breakdown of Speaker Participation by Class

Hereâ€™s a table showing the number of speakers by the classes theyâ€™re participating in:
- Only one speaker is covering **6 classes**.
- Another speaker is leading **5 classes**.
- Two speakers are featured in **4 classes**.
- The majority of speakers, however, are presenting in just **1 class**.

This breakdown highlights the variety in participation and the broad representation across various topics.
