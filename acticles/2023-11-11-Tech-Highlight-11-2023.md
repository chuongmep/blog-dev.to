## Dynamo In Forma

Autodesk has released [Dynamo in Forma](https://dynamobim.org/dynamo-in-forma/) Beta, an eagerly awaited extension offering design automation for architects, urban designers, and real estate developers. Forma, an AI-powered platform, aids decision-making in early urban development.

Dynamo Player Beta, an extension within Forma, streamlines automation, providing a user-friendly interface and customizable parameters. It promotes reusability and collaboration by enabling the sharing of automation graphs. To install, users must add the DynamoFormaBeta package to Dynamo and set up the extension in Forma. Despite being in early development, users are encouraged to explore and contribute feedback, marking the beginning of Forma's enhanced automation capabilities.

## AEC Data Model API beta

The [AEC Data Model API](https://aps.autodesk.com/developer/overview/aec-data-model-api) provides the functionality to work directly with data models in the cloud, allowing you to read, write, and extend the data you need without having to build special plug-ins for your desktop authoring tools. 

![](https://aps.autodesk.com/sites/default/files/styles/paragraph_image/public/2023-09/aec_data_model-1.jpeg?itok=BW6ML8dv)

Use the API to browse seamlessly through hubs, projects, folders, files, down to elements and parameters, from anywhere. With simple data model interaction, the API adds efficiency, flexibility, and enhanced collaboration to your architecture, engineering, and construction workflows.

The sample is using the GraphiQL project that makes it really easy to discover the AEC CIM Data API. It also integrates with the Viewer in order contextualize the query results.

I'm still confuse why I'm need create a account before I can read the documentation or anything, because require login at the fist time is not a good experience for me now with Open Source. I hope they can change it in the future.

## EMARF
