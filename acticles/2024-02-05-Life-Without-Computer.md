## Me and Computer

I consider myself incredibly fortunate to have had exposure to computers. The computer enabled me to learn, explore, work, communicate, and so much more. It's hard to imagine my life without them. I often reflect on how lucky I'm to have been born in the digital age. My parents, on the other hand, didn't have the same luxury. They grew up in the era of the **Vietnam War**, a time when computers were not as ubiquitous as they are today. Yet, they lived happily without computer.

It seems I'm someone who can't live without a computer. I work with computers, entertain myself with them, learn from them, and communicate through them. I once tried to live without a computer for a week, and I found it incredibly challenging. Perhaps fate has bound me to these machines.

I vividly remember the first time I laid hands on a computer; it was around 14 year ago when I young. It felt like something entirely new and exciting. Computer games, educational software, and entertainment websites opened up a whole new world for me, and they continue to do so. Without a computer, I wouldn't have access to these opportunities.

I've become a proficient computer enthusiast, delving into every aspect of these machines. I can fix them, install software, programâ€”you name it. It excites me every day. Whenever someone encounters computer problems, I'm always eager to help. It's a fantastic feeling.


## Life Beyond the Screen

I could spend hours, even entire days, engrossed in my computer without feeling tired. However, I've come to realize that life without a computer is also wonderful. I can go for walks, admire nature, read books, listen to music, and much more. It helps me see the world around me more clearly.

Without a computer, I have more time to communicate with my family and friends. I feel fortunate to be able to chat with my parents, siblings, and friends. I'm grateful to hear their interesting stories and offer them support in their daily lives through advice, listening, sharing, and more.

## Conclusion

Computers are incredible tools, but life without them is also remarkable. It largely depends on the timing and one's perspective. For me, at this moment, life without a computer is becoming increasingly important. It's about embracing the analog aspects of life and finding joy in simplicity.
