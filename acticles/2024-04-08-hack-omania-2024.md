## Introduction

Last week, my team had the opportunity to participate in the [HackOMania 2024](https://hackomania.geekshacking.com/) Hackathon, organized by the GeeksHacking community. It was an amazing experience delivering a Generative AI Workshop. I met many people who have an interest in Generative AI, think about new ideas, and build a team to join the hackathon to create something amazing.

We built a team and worked `24 hours` on a project that we called "Geen Home", an innovative project designed to help residents optimize their energy usage through AI-powered recommendations and appliance usage data. Developed during the Hackomani-2024 event by the GreenHomeTeam, this project aims to address the common challenge of reducing home energy bills and fostering more efficient energy consumption habits.

Team Members under the GreenHomeTeam:

- Chuong Ho - Backend Engineer - chuongpqvn@gmail.com
- Pingasari T. - Product Owner - pingasari@gmail.com
- Wu Yifei - Business Analyst - wyifei51@gmail.com
- Shubham Matta - Backend Engineer - shubhammatta1@gmail.com

Project Overview

Residents often struggle with high energy bills due to inefficient appliance use and habits. Green Home offers a no-sensor solution, purely software-based, to provide cheap, easy-to-maintain, and easy-to-install alternatives to traditional energy consumption optimization methods.
Key Features

- Smart AI Scanner: Effortlessly scan appliances to gather usage data.
- AI-powered Dashboard: Gain insights into your energy consumption patterns.
- Tailored Recommendations: Receive personalized tips to improve energy efficiency.
- Cost-effective: A pure software solution that doesn't require expensive IoT home sensors.

Future Plans

Our post-MVP roadmap includes:

- Multi-appliance bulk processing with video input.
- Integration with SP's My Carbon Footprint for a holistic view of environmental impact.
- AI tuning improvements for enhanced prediction accuracy.
Expansion to water consumption habits for comprehensive utility optimization.
- Increased marketing efforts to encourage user participation.

## Vision
Our vision is to become the go-to app for building efficient utilities consumption habits in Singapore, eventually expanding our reach to empower users worldwide to live more sustainably.

## Activities

During the event, we participated in a variety of activities, including:

- Resolve technical challenges connect and detect camera on mobile devices to connect with LLM use Open AI to recommend the best information for devices.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for the mobile application.
- Database linking and data analysis to provide personalized recommendations.
- Analyze user data to provide personalized recommendations for energy efficiency.
- Create a presentation to showcase our project to the judges.

What happened at the end of the event? We were thrilled to present our project to the judges and showcase all the hard work we put into it. We were proud of what we had accomplished in just 24 hours and were excited to see what the other teams had created.

- What happened after I went home?

I slept so well after the event, I was so tired but happy. I think my team did a great job and I'm so proud of them.
