## Introduction

Digital transformation is a hot topic in the construction industry. It is a process of using digital technologies to create new or modify existing business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet changing business and market requirements. This reimagining of business in the digital age is digital transformation.

## Let's Try Change The Culture

The first thing we need to do before we start digital transformation in BIM is to change the culture. The construction industry is known for its traditional ways of working, and it is not easy to change the culture. However, it is essential to change the culture to make digital transformation successful. We need to create a culture that is open to change and innovation. We need to encourage our employees to embrace new technologies and new ways of working. We need to create a culture that is open to collaboration and sharing of information. We need to create a culture that is open to learning and continuous improvement.

## Invest in Training

Training is sometimes even more critical than digital transformation itself. It helps a team understand and achieve adherence to principles, guide processes, and gain knowledge about their work. This ensures they are working with a good process and can thus conceive of more progressive workflows. What happens when digitization occurs but nobody knows how to use the old tools, or even about the existence of certain features? It leads to digital transformation getting stuck in a loop that isn't always easy to break out of.

## Honesty

Honesty appears to be a crucial factor leading to the success of digital transformation. If a team isn't honest with each other, they won't be able to learn from one another, improve their workflows, devise new processes, or create superior products. They won't be able to compete with other companies. Sometimes, honesty is even more important than anything else in digital transformation.

## Understanding the Process

In many years of working with automation, I've realized that automation issues are only resolved when individuals within the company truly understand what they're doing, which processes they're implementing, and how effective they are before the digital transformation team intervenes. Successful digital transformation truly requires understanding the job, the current process, and how it's being done correctly before there's an opportunity to improve it.

I have witnessed numerous cases where the use of automation software is on the rise, yet users still lack a clear understanding of their functionality. This often leads to misuse and unintended complications. This also implies that companies will need to invest more in training their employees on new digital transformation processes.

## Conclusion

Digital transformation is always a headache for many companies, but if they genuinely understand their work, are truly honest with each other, invest in training, and are genuinely capable of changing their work culture, they will have the opportunity to succeed in digital transformation. Otherwise, it's challenging to move forward and they may end up in an inescapable loop.
