## Description

The project [Revit Meows](https://github.com/chuongmep/revit-meows) simplifies data extraction from Revit model in [ACC](https://construction.autodesk.com/) using the
Model [Derivative API](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2). Leveraging
powerful [Python](https://www.python.org/) libraries, it enables efficient visualization and analysis
of [Revit](https://www.autodesk.com/sg/products/revit/overview) data. The api released long time but quite complex and
hard to use, this is library to help you access with easier way.

## Installation

```bash
pip install revit_meows --upgrade
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+

- Setting Environment Variables, see
  Tutorial [Create an App](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/tutorials/create-app/)

```bash
APS_CLIENT_PKCE_ID=your_client_id
APS_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
APS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

## Simple Usage

- Get All Categories

```python
from revit_meows import APSRevit
from aps_toolkit import Auth

token = Auth().auth3leg()
urn = "<urn of item version>"
revit_meows = APSRevit(urn, token)
categories = revit_meows.get_all_categories()
print(categories)
```

- Export All Revit Data To CSV

```python
from revit_meows import APSRevit
from aps_toolkit import Auth

token = Auth().auth3leg()
urn = "<urn of item version>"
revit_meows = APSRevit(urn, token, region="US")
df = revit_meows.get_all_data()
df.to_csv("revit_data.csv")
```

- Export All Data Include Boundingbox To CSV

```python
from revit_meows import APSRevit
from aps_toolkit import Auth

token = Auth().auth3leg()
urn = "<urn of item version>"
revit_meows = APSRevit(urn, token, region="US")
df = revit_meows.get_all_data_bbox(project_id="<project_id>", 
                                   model_guid="<model_guid>", 
                                   is_field_param=False,
                                   is_include_category=True)
df.to_csv("revit_data_bbox.csv")
```

## Q&A

<details><summary>How can I get URN input?</summary>

1. You can use `aps-toolkit` library to get URN of the item latest version.

```python
from aps_toolkit import *

token = Auth().auth2leg()
bim360 = BIM360(token)
urn = bim360.get_latest_derivative_urn("<project_id>", "<folder_id>")
```

2. You can batch report urn to dataframe from BIM360 class in `aps-toolkit` library.

```python
from aps_toolkit import BIM360
from aps_toolkit import Auth

token = Auth().auth3leg()
bim360 = BIM360(token)
df = bim360.batch_report_items("<project_id>", "<folder_id>", ['.rvt'], is_sub_folder=False)
```

Oh, my girlfriend told me the cat is so cute, Meows is the sound of the cat. So, I named it.
