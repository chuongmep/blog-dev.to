## Summary

![AddinManager](pic/Addin.png)

Usually, when developing and debugging an addin with **Autocad** or **Civil3D** API, user has to close & re-open **Autocad** or **Civil3D** each time
he/she modifies the addin code and wants to re-compile. But with **Add-In Manager**, user can modify and run the Addin.
directly without closing & re-opening **Autocad** or **Civil3D** again and again.This is a next branch from [Revit Addin Manager](https://github.com/chuongmep/RevitAddInManager)
to support multiple platform API for developer. With current technology, you can use [Hot Reload](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/hot-reload?view=vs-2022) to speed it up.But try this project it will be faster with any Addin.
