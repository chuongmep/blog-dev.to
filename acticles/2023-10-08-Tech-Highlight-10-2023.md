## Introduction

As a update of the tech highlight, I will try to write down some interesting tech news I found in the week. I hope you enjoy it.

## Rayon

[Rayon](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/rayon-is-a-collaborative-design-tool-for-architects-and-designers/) is a collaborative design tool for architects and designers. When you think about collaborative design tools, chances are you immediately start thinking about Figma, the popular design tool that Adobe wants to acquire for $20 billion (by the way, that acquisition is still pending regulatory approval). A relatively new French startup called Rayon wants to apply the Figma formula to another sector â€” the architecture, engineering and construction industries.

## Orange Visual Programming

The core principle of [Orange](https://orange3.readthedocs.io/projects/orange-visual-programming/en/latest/building-workflows/index.html) is visual programming, which means each analytical step in contained within a widget. Widgets are placed on the canvas and connected into an analytical workflow, which is executed from left to right. Orange never passes data backwards.

## Milvus

Vector database built for scalable similarity search, Open-source, highly scalable, and blazing fast.

Milvus was created in 2019 with a singular goal: store, index, and manage massive embedding vectors generated by deep neural networks and other machine learning (ML) models.

As a database specifically designed to handle queries over input vectors, it is capable of indexing vectors on a trillion scale. Unlike existing relational databases which mainly deal with structured data following a pre-defined pattern, Milvus is designed from the bottom-up to handle embedding vectors converted from unstructured data.
