### What is this?

[RevitPythonShell](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/revitpythonshell) (RPS) is essentially a small add-in for Autodesk Revit that allows users to write plugins using the **Python** programming language. The standout feature of RPS is its ability to display results immediately after you write the code, making it incredibly efficient. Combined with tools like <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup" target="_blank">RevitLookup</a>, it enhances your capabilities with the Revit API significantlyâ€”like adding wings to a dragon!

### How to Install?

Like any other add-in for Revit, installation is straightforward using the provided `.exe` files. Here are the links to download the setup files for different Revit versions:

- <a href="data/2017.03.07_Setup_RevitPythonShell_2016.exe" target="_blank">Autodesk Revit 2016</a>  
- <a href="data/2017.04.06_Setup_RevitPythonShell_2017.exe" target="_blank">Autodesk Revit 2017</a>  
- <a href="data/2017.07.24_Setup_RevitPythonShell_2018.exe" target="_blank">Autodesk Revit 2018</a>  
- <a href="data/2018.09.19_Setup_RevitPythonShell_2019.exe" target="_blank">Autodesk Revit 2019</a>  
- <a href="data/2020.01.19_Setup_RevitPythonShell_2020.exe" target="_blank">Autodesk Revit 2020</a>  

Once installed, you will find a new yellow icon in the **Ribbon** tab of Revit. Thatâ€™s your RevitPythonShell! ðŸ˜Ž

### How to Use and Write Code?

Now that itâ€™s installed, letâ€™s play around with it. Start by opening the `Interactive Python Shell` from the Ribbon.

It looks quite sleek! Letâ€™s type a simple "Hello, World!" to see if it works.

Boom! It works instantlyâ€”pretty impressive, right? Time to show this off to my spouse! ðŸ¤£

Next, letâ€™s try something more advanced, like interacting with elements in Revit using a simple script. You can click **Run** to execute the code.

```python
from Autodesk.Revit.UI.Selection import *
uidoc = __revit__.ActiveUIDocument
doc = __revit__.ActiveUIDocument.Document
selection = [doc.GetElement(elId) for elId in __revit__.ActiveUIDocument.Selection.GetElementIds()]
ElementID = []
ElementName = []
Category = []
for i in selection:
    ElementID.append(i.Id)
    ElementName.append(i.Name)
    Category.append(i.Category.Name)
print(ElementID, ElementName, Category)
```

The result looks like this:

If youâ€™ve reached this point and find it tricky, donâ€™t panicâ€”youâ€™re just getting started. ðŸ˜Ž RPS is incredibly useful for testing or implementing new ideas. Below, Iâ€™ve included some additional learning resources that may help you refine your skills and discover new possibilities.

### Additional Tips

Currently, thereâ€™s a library called **Revit Python Wrapper**, which simplifies coding with Revit even further. You can explore it here: <a href="https://revitpythonwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html" target="_blank">Revit Python Wrapper Documentation</a>. Give it a tryâ€”it might make your life even easier!
