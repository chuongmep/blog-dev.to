## Introduction

Today, I would like to share with you some of the useful technology that I have learned in the past month. I hope it will be useful for you. I'm so interested in the technology that I'm learning and I'm so excited to share it with you. I hope you will be interested in it too.


## Bowerbird

[Bowerbird](https://github.com/ara3d/bowerbird) accelerates C# tool and plug-in development by dynamically compiling C# source files. It scans a directory for `.cs` files, compiles them into an assembly, and loads them into memory. The assembly is then scanned for public classes implementing `IBowerbirdCommand`. Editing and saving triggers recompilation and reloading of commands. This approach reduces overhead and speeds up development for Autodesk Revit plug-ins. Bowerbird facilitates experimentation and idea testing without restarting the host application. Inspired by projects like pyRevit and Revit.ScriptCS, it aims to streamline plug-in development. Feedback is appreciated, and contributions are welcomed via the GitHub repository.

I'm so happy because it may be can use to improvement or replace [RevitAddInManager](https://github.com/chuongmep/RevitAddInManager) in future.

## VASA demo from this week's Forma Hackathon

I saw author [Håvard Wormdal Høiby](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7166744580279803904/) posted a lot awesome hackathon project in here (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7166744580279803904/) and really like it. I hope I can learn and explore more from topic. The topic [Forma AR](https://piromancy.com/events/forma-hackathon-2024/) it is really interesting.

## Generative AI Architectural Patterns

[Debmalya Biswas](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/generative-ai-architectural-patterns-debmalya-biswas-hlvye/?trackingId=wW0DWmYZmA52F6rjVwZSYA%3D%3D) shared a short primer on the 5 most prevalent Generative AI architectural patterns today:

1. Black-box LLM APIs
2. Enterprise Apps in LLM App Store
3. LLMOps — LLM fine-tuning
4. Retrieval Augmented Generation (hashtag#RAG)
5. Multi-agent LLM Orchestration
