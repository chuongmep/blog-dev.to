## Introduction

Today, I would like to share with you some of the useful technology that I have learned in the past month. I hope it will be useful for you. I'm so interested in the technology that I'm learning and I'm so excited to share it with you. I hope you will be interested in it too.

## Excel Python

Excel users now have access to powerful analytics via Python for visualizations, cleaning data, machine learning, predictive analytics, and more. Users can now create end to end solutions that seamlessly combine Excel and Python â€“ all within Excel. Using Excelâ€™s built-in connectors and Power Query, users can easily bring external data into Python in Excel workflows. Python in Excel is compatible with the tools users already know and love, such as formulas, PivotTables, and Excel charts.

## Architectural layout

This [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926580523003138?dgcid=author) introduces a groundbreaking deep-learning approach to empower architects in efficiently creating appealing and practical architectural space configurations. By employing deep learning algorithms to analyze input bubble diagrams' graph structure, architects gain control over node-based space layouts within defined borders. 

This approach strikes a balance between creative freedom and practical constraints, streamlining the building design process. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of this data-driven method in automating space layout design, enhancing productivity and efficiency.

Architects can now interactively generate floor plans with ease, leveraging a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) tailored to topological adjacency graphs. This iterative workflow refines design solutions, ensuring they meet both geometrical and topological requirements, revolutionizing architectural design.

I'm also have a basic visualization sample for graph layout. You can see it [here](https://github.com/chuongmep/jsGraph)

## Central64

[Central64](https://github.com/Autodesk/Central64) is a header-only C++ library for approximating shortest paths through 2D grid-based environments. The library supports a variety of online path planning methods that do not require precomputation. All of the methods provide an option to produce central grid paths. All of the methods can be used with any of the standard rectangular grid neighborhoods up to 64 neighbors. See the Central64 Technical Report (PDF) for an overview of the methods and options supported by the library.
